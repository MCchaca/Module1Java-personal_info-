//pseudocode is easily understood code for any average reader to grasp what is happening in a program
//i will think of it as caveman code

//PURPOSE: Define a persons variables, then print variables

BEGIN

import scanner //from a google search, this is how inputs(what a user types in) are read in JAva

class Main{  //Main classes are what are first run in a program. 
  public static void main(String[]) args); //from a search, this keys in the computer to where to start the program, still kind of confusing
  //caveman time

  //first define variables
  first = "Billy"
  last = "Bob"
  address = "123 tinstafl lane"
  city = "moon"
  zip = "424242"

  //now print the variables to screen
  //from a search in Java, printing is a little more complex than python because it has to incluide "+ 'variable name'"
  print "first" + first
  print "last" + last
  print "address" + address
  print "city" + city
  print "zip" + zip
}

END

//program should be done
//CONFUSION PARTS: void main???     how to do user inputs and outputs?     printing those user variables??
